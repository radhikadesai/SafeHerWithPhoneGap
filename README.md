# SafeHerWithPhoneGap
###What would you do if you are walking back home all alone, on a shady road and you feel like someone is following you? About to mug you? Or is it just all in your head!? What would you do?  
<br/>
In such situations you want to just feel safe, rather than dialling 911 immediately. 
Also, you would not want to alert the suspected attacker by taking out the phone and dialing home etc.

So we have come up with an IOT solution for this problem. 
The user can just press a button (on a wearable device) and that would then send messages and your location information to your safety circle through your phone. The moment you feel safe, you can press the button twice to mark yourself safe.

Also, if you are in an emergency situation, you would not have the time to take out your phone, then search for a safety app and then press some button on it. 
For this purpose, the user can just press the button thrice, and the phone will place a call to 911.

Technology used for communication between edison and phone is bluetooth.
